Roman numbers are used in many places though the repeating characters confusethereaders.This quest is on converting a Roman number to Hindu-Arabic number. Consider couple of Roman numbers are stored in a text file (roman_numbers.txt). 
Each numberis stored in single line. Some of the numbers have errors such as four repeating digits, threeVs,and etc. 
The Roman number may be in upper or lower case format, or may be inmixcases. It is assumed that only numbers between 1 and 200 are stored in the file. 
This programme is developed to read the Roman numbers in the file and present thevalue of the Roman number in Hindu-Arabic format in console mode. 
Other than the format errors, Roman number in the file may contain characters which are not in Roman number system. If thereis/are any error in the Roman number, the word "error" will be displayed.
